            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>Are come from both Houses, and are not believ'd.</l>
               <l>The better to help them for running and flying,</l>
               <l>We have put them in Verse to authorize their lyingâ–ª</l>
               <l>For it has beene debated and found to be true,</l>
               <l>That lying's a Parliament priviledge too.</l>
               <l>And that they may the sooner our conquests rehearse,</l>
               <l>We are minded to put them in galloping verse.</l>
               <l>But so many maim'd souldiers from Reading there came,</l>
               <l>That in spite of the Surgeons make our verses run lame.</l>
               <l>We have ever us'd factions, and now it is knowne,</l>

               <l>On Monday both Houses fell into debate</l>
               <l>And were likely to fall by the eares as they sate,</l>
               <l>Yet would they not have the businesse decided.</l>
               <l>That they (as the kingdome is) might be divided.</l>
               <l>They had an intention to prayers to goe,</l>
               <l>But <hi>extempore</hi> prayers are now common too.</l>

               <l>Tis onely free loane, yet this order they make,</l>
               <l>That what men would give they should plunder and take:</l>
               <l>Upon this the word plunder came into their minde,</l>
               <l>And all of them did labour a new one to finde.</l>
               <l>They baptiz'd it Distraining, yet thought it no shame</l>
               <l>To persist in the act which they blusht for to name:</l>
               <l>And among other Acts the Law to distraine</l>
               <l>Was made by King <hi>Pius,</hi> the first yeare of his reigne.</l>
               <l>They voted all persons from Oxford that came,</l>
               <l>Should be apprehended, and after the same</l>
               <l>With an humble petition the King they request</l>

               <l>Cessation was voted a dangerous plot,</l>
               <l>Because the King would have it, both houses would not:</l>
               <l>But when they resolv'd it abroad must be blowne,</l>

               <l>Lest the truth should peepe through their juggling dresse.</l>
               <l>For they knew a Cessation would worke them more harmes,</l>
               <l>Then Essex can doe the Cavalleres with his armes:</l>
               <l>While they keepe the ships and the sorts in their hand,</l>
               <l>They may be traytors by sea as well as by land.</l>
               <l>The forts will preserve them as long as they stay,</l>
               <l>And the ships carry them and their plunder away.</l>
               <l>They have therefore good reason to count war the better,</l>
               <l>For the Law will hrove to them but a killing letter.</l>
